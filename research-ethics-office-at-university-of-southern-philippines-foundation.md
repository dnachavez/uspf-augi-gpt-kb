It is essential for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of research participants and maintaining the integrity of research processes.

### Vision, Mission, & Goals

**Vision:** The Office of the Research Ethics Committee at USPF aims to promote adherence to ethical guidelines uniquely aligned with the universityâ€™s research objectives.

**Mission:** The office is dedicated to ensuring ethical practices across various research disciplines, emphasizing integrity, safety, and respect for humanity.

**Goals:**

### Research Ethics Clearance Application Guidelines

The Research Ethics Office provides clear guidelines for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students for their thesis or dissertation work. Each research proposal, called the "Study Protocol," must be approved and improved based on departmental feedback before applying for research ethics clearance.

**Application Steps:**
1. Secure a signed Recommendation Letter for Research Ethics Review from both the research adviser and the research panel chairperson.
2. Submit this letter, along with a cover letter, to the Research Ethics Committee.
3. Upon application acknowledgment, submit a detailed study protocol and USPF REC forms in PDF format.
4. Expect a processing fee, calculated based on the client type; subsequent related applications are free.
5. Receive and edit standardized informed consent forms, necessary for the participation of study volunteers, to align with the study protocol.

### Policies on Informed Consent

Informed consent is crucial for any research involving human participants. The office provides standardized templates to ensure clarity and completeness in communication with participants. Researchers are tasked with ensuring that all information is precisely stated to inform participants adequately.

### Handling Specific Participant Groups

Special guidelines are provided for research involving minors, especially regarding assent forms and respecting the autonomy of minors in consenting to participation. The decisions about when assent forms are necessary lies with the Research Ethics Committee.

### Research Instruments and Methodologies

Ensure research instruments are authorized by their creators and documented as appendices within the study. Online surveys require detailed arrangements for consent forms, ensuring participants are fully informed before accessing the research itself.
