## Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy at the University of Southern Philippines Foundation

The Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy program at the University of Southern Philippines Foundation (USPF) has established a strong reputation since its inception in 2004. Initially beginning with just three students and two part-time teachers, the program was designed to support the booming demand for healthcare professionals, particularly in the nursing field at the time. However, over the years, it has grown considerably in both size and prestige, attracting students from across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

The College of Health Sciences, where the Pharmacy Department is housed, plays a vital role in meeting the demands of the pharmaceutical industry. Its focus is to supply the industry with competent and highly trained pharmacists who can excel in various sectors, including community pharmacies, hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, and academia.

A unique aspect of the USPF Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy program is its commitment to inclusivity, aligning with the principle of "no student left behind." This commitment ensures that a diverse body of students, regardless of their geographic or socio-economic background, receives a quality education that prepares them for the challenges of the pharmaceutical field.

The Pharmacy program at USPF emphasizes a comprehensive curriculum that covers a range of essential topics, including drug formulation, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and patient care. These courses are designed to provide students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to become effective pharmacists. 

As the program continues to evolve and expand, it remains dedicated to advancing healthcare education and contributing to the broader pharmaceutical industry. The College of Pharmacy seeks to produce graduates who are not only skilled practitioners but also leaders in promoting health and wellness in society.
