## Participatory Development at the University of Southern Philippines Foundation

Participatory development is an approach to community engagement that emphasizes the active involvement of community members in all stages of development projects. The University of Southern Philippines Foundation (USPF) incorporates this approach through its Community Extension Services (CES), which is dedicated to providing community-based services and outreach programs to adopted communities.

### Brief History of CES

The CES office at USPF was established to extend community service and outreach from the university and its departments to local communities. These efforts focus on addressing the specific needs of the communities through programs that range from health education and capacity-building workshops to job readiness training and environmental sustainability initiatives. By equipping communities with necessary tools and resources, CES aims to enhance the quality of life for individuals and communities alike.

The initiative's primary goal is to forge strong, sustainable relationships between the university and the communities it serves, while also advancing research, knowledge, and innovation in ways that are mutually beneficial.

### Overview of CES Approach

USPF embraces the principle of participatory development, which is founded on the idea that true development enables people to take control of their lives. This approach involves equipping individuals with information and resources to understand and improve their circumstances. Community members are engaged as partners in every phase of project implementation—from needs assessment, planning, and execution, to monitoring and evaluation. This participation ensures that communities can independently manage needs-based and sustainable projects, even in the absence of the university.

While planning programs, CES considers global, national, and local realities, including international and local development models. Special attention is given to vulnerable populations, such as children, women, the elderly, people with disabilities, indigenous groups, and environmental concerns.

This network of partners supports diverse initiatives, from education and health to environmental sustainability and disaster preparedness.

In summary, USPF’s approach to participatory development serves as a model for fostering resilient communities through active involvement and partnership, empowering them to identify and implement solutions to their unique challenges.
