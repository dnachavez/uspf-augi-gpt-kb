## Learning Resource Center (TESDA)

The Learning Resource Center (LRC) at the University of Southern Philippines Foundation was established in 1996, aiming to address the growing demand for certificate-based non-formal education tailored for learners unable to pursue traditional four-year courses or bachelor's degree programs. Originally known as "Blue Collar Job" preparation, the center offered training that aligned individuals with employment opportunities in Singapore, significantly focusing on the training of domestic helpers.

The vision for the LRC was driven by the then Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs, L. D. Jereza, who leveraged his position as President of the Association of Non-Traditional Education in the Philippines (ANTEP) to forge partnerships with various industries, broadening opportunities for students.

Following the transformation of the National Manpower & Youth Council (NMYC) into the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), the LRC evolved to provide various Technical Vocational Livelihood (TVL) Programs. Its partnership with TESDA accredited the center to offer programs such as Food & Beverage Services NC II, Hotel Housekeeping NC II, Bread & Pastry Production NC II, and Cookery NC II.

Serving as a Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) center, the LRC at USPF has developed key collaborations and received various recognitions. Highlights include:

1. Deployment of mobile trainers across resorts in Mactan and beyond, providing operational training and designing manuals.
2. Reception of scholar grants in Cookery from government officials.
3. Collaborations with food industry partners to enhance culinary skills through international exposure.
4. Development of bakery-owner skills programs to support potential franchise ventures.
5. Establishment of a Memorandum of Agreement with Japan, endorsing the center for caregiving programs, including Niponggo language skills.

Acclaimed as a TESDA Assessment Center, USPF LRC provides evaluations for Cookery NC II, Food & Beverage Services NC II, Hotel Housekeeping NC II, Bread & Pastry Production NC II, Barista NC II, and Trainers Methodology Level I. Notably, USPF hosts Cebu City's sole Barista Training and Assessment Center, marked by the opening of Centro Caffeâ€™ in 2018.

The LRC has maintained its role as a vital contributor to skills development in the region for over 25 years, refining human competency through dedicated training in various trades.
