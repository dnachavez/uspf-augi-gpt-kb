## School of Law at the University of Southern Philippines Foundation

The School of Law at the University of Southern Philippines Foundation (USPF) has a rich history dating back to 1933 when collegiate courses were first introduced in arts, sciences, education, commerce, law, and engineering. In 1937, the institution transitioned from Southern Institute to Southern College, further evolving into the University of Southern Philippines in 1949. This evolution marked the inception of various graduate programs, including the Master of Laws.

The School of Law at USPF resumed operations in 1999, reinvigorating its commitment to legal education. The law school is housed on the second floor of the Don Agustin Jereza building, providing a conducive learning environment with fully air-conditioned classrooms and free Wi-Fi. It also features a moot court, a Legal Aid office, and facilities for the LEX Circle and Bar Operations. The School of Law Library is conveniently located on the same floor.

Under the leadership of Dean Alicia Evangelista Bathan and Assistant Dean Peter B. Cañamo, the college boasts a team of esteemed law professors known for their expertise in various fields of practice. This accomplished faculty has helped foster a community known as the USPF Law Family, producing notable alumni like Rene Espina, who was a top placer in the 1954 Bar Examinations.

The School of Law offers a Juris Doctor (JD) program—a non-thesis degree that qualifies graduates to take the Philippine Bar examinations. Adopting a flexible academic calendar from August to June, the program offers flexibility in class schedules, with weekday and weekend classes, allowing students to tailor their legal education around their personal commitments.

Driven by the mission to nurture competent and ethical lawyers, the School of Law is focused on providing a legal education that equips students with a profound understanding of Philippine and international law. The institution aims to fulfill the vision of the late Dr. Ronald Duterte—to be recognized as one of the leading law schools in the Visayas and across the country.
